I am an infectious disease researcher and spend most of my time thinking about 
climate-sensitive (e.g. vector-borne, WASH) and vaccine-preventable 
(e.g. seasonal influenza, hand foot and mouth disease, SARS-CoV-2) infectious 
diseases. My research is highly multi-disciplinary, cutting across epidemiology,
math, statistics, economics, and policy. My work involves burden of disease assessment

## Current projects
💉 Together with colleagues @ the [KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme](https://kemri-wellcome.org/),
I work on modelling the impact of COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle- income
settings as a part of the [Vaccine impact modelling consortium](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/)
